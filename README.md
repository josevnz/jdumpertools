# JDUMPERTOOLS

I wanted to have a few very fast set of programs to dump easy to get information from my Linux system into a JSON enabled search engine. I got tired of writting Python wrappers for them so here is the result.

They do not intend to replace tools like 'du' or 'who' and their functionality is VERY limited on purpouse. Their goal is:

* Write the output in JSON format
* Be easy to use
* Be fast

You can manipulate their output with other cool tools like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), etc.
